Instructions : 
Run project1.m file 
for train_cfs, test_cfs for the closed form solution method 

Gor GD :
train_gd, test_gd for the gradient decent method.


To vary the parameter, change the value of lambda_cfs  in program1.m file. The M values are iteratively computed from M=1 to M=30 to output the most optimum solution. 

Execute program1.m file 
NOTE: The computation of mean and variance has been randomized and the technique illustrated in the project report this way. 

For GD method, the error is caclulated iteratively for various values of M.
